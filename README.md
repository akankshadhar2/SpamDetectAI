# SpamDetectAI
Developed Email Spam Detector, compared Deep Learning, SVM, RF, XGBoost; 

This repository contains code for an Email Spam Detector project. The project aims to develop a model to detect spam emails using various machine learning algorithms and conduct a comparative analysis of their performance.
# Requirements #
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Python (version >= 3.6)
Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost)

# Dataset #
The dataset used for this project is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can obtain a suitable dataset from various public sources or use your own labeled dataset for training and evaluation.

# Results #
The notebook will generate evaluation metrics (precision, recall, f1 score) for each model on the test dataset. The model with the best performance will be identified.
